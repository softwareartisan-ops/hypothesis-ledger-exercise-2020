Hypothesis Ledger application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Source code: 
-app.py: Contain the classes and the code that runs the program.

1) The system should be able to process ledger of transactions, using the following format:
example ledger of transactions:
    2015-01-16,john,mary,125.00
    2015-01-17,john,supermarket,20.00
    2015-01-17,mary,insurance,100.00

ledgerData.csv:  is an input .csv file that contains ledger testing data.

2) Provide access to the account of each of the named parties.

3) Find out what each party's balance is at a specified date

#Assumptions:
 - All accounts start with balance = 0.0
 - Generate the test Data.
 - No need to implement any kind of user interface for the program.


 #Run the Program (Windows Shell, Unix, ...):
 $python app.py
